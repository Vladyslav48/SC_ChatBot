# Clojure ChatBot
## Background
* A group project for the 2004 Symbolic Computation class instructed by Petr Švarný at Prague College. All the project's branches (development milestones) are availiable at [Github Page](https://dec0rtez.github.io/SC_ChatBot/).
## Objective
* To create a basic ChatBot able to converse with the user about the various parks in Prague. The chatbot is written in Clojure in a way which allows it to be adapted and expanded upon according to progressively more demanding requirements.

## Requirements
* Working Clojure REPL on system
* Alternatively access to an online REPL such as [repl.it](https://repl.it/)

## Installation
* No installation required. 
* All features of the code can be used directly from a .clj file in a REPL.
* NOTE: the code was written and tested on Clojure vesion 1.8.0. The "clojure.string/includes?" functionality can be unavailable in older versions of Clojure.

## Usage
* To start the chatbot in REPL, run the chatbot.clj file and type: (chatbot) to run the function.
* Once the chatbot has taken your name and you have selected a park to ask questions about, you can ask questions about the selected park. The ChatBot will check the input, identify what the user is asking about and generate a coherent response. 
* To end the conversation with the chatbot by typing one of the following words: end, stop, bye, goodbye and farewell. (works only after username and park have been chosen.)

## Support
* If you wish to make suggestions about the chatbot directly to the creators, ask for assistance or get involved in the project, please reach out to us on [discord](https://discord.gg/XRJ2GbMf).
